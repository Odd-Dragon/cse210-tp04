# cse210-tp04
## Greed Game
Greed is a game in which you catch falling gemstones (and sometimes rocks!) in a cavern. It's utterly addictive due to the fact that you can keep playing even once you're in negative digits, driving you on with the prospect of getting back what you lost.
## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 cse210-tp04 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
